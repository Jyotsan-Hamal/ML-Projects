# Movie Recommendation System
## It is based on content based filtering where each movie vectors is mapped by cosine similarity in n dimensional space and if you want,to use the code the (similar.pkl) file is missing because repository doesn't allow the size more than 25mb. so I couldn't upload the file but if you want please email me : hamaljyotsan@gamil.com or  you can just message me in insta link in profile. 
## It's not that Great Recommendation Sysrem but would be glad if you just would read and provide ways so that i can improve
