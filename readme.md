# Repository for ML Projects

This repository contains machine learning projects that I have worked on. The projects will cover a range of topics, including classification, regression, clustering, and deep learning.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run the machine learning projects, you will need the following:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- The following Python libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch

### Installation

To install the required Python libraries, run the following command:
pip install -r requirements.txt

### Usage

Each project is contained in a separate directory. To run a project, navigate to the project directory and open the Jupyter Notebook file.

The notebooks contain detailed explanations of the data, the problem, and the solution. You can run the code cells in the notebook to reproduce the results.
